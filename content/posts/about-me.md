I am Wei Li, an exam-exempted master's student who majors in cyberspace security at [School of Cyber Engineering](https://ceen.xidian.edu.cn/), [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) (XDU), China. I'm a former [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) player in [L-team](https://l.xdsec.org/) and [XDSEC](https://xdsec.org/). My research interest falls in securing software systems via formal methods.

During my undergraduate education, I mostly focused on CTF competitions and extracurricular activities of the information security club XDSEC. By self-study and cooperation with my teammates, I have been granted a postgraduate recommendation due to my performance in information security-related competitions.

I’m currently teaching myself in the area of program logic and its related background knowledge. Here is my CV ([pdf version](https://github.com/hu4i/autoCV/raw/build/cv.pdf)):
